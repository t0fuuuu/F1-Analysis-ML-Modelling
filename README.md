## üêé‚ú® **Formula 1 Dataset Analysis, Preparation, and Modelling** ‚ú®üöó


### **<u>Content Overview & Purpose</u>**

The Formula 1 Dataset provides a total of 11 distinct tables, each containing different information on Formula 1 Details (Circuits, Drivers, etc.). Throughout this notebook, we explore how relationships are formed within the tables, create a value-based problem from in-depth analysis, and lastly, prepare the data through various wrangling processes.

These are the following data wrangling concepts covered, including in-depth explanations on each procedure:

  ‚ô• Outlier Handling
  
  ‚ô• Missing Value Imputation
  
  ‚ô• Categorical Encoding
  
  ‚ô• Numerical Transformation

  ‚ô• Variable Discretization
  
  ‚ô• Scale Normalisation/Standardisation
  
  ‚ô• Feature Creation/Removal
